## Project Goals

The aim of this project is to create a text-based command line project management application. Using CSV files as the basis for storing the information, the program should be able to read, write and amend information contained within the spreadsheet. The user should also be able to have different statuses for each 'Job'. These statuses will include the following:

- Pending - The end user has not accepted or started the job yet.
- Ongoing - The user is at any point between Pending and Complete. The job is not yet finished, but it has started and is being done by the user.
- Complete - The job has been finished.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas for manipulating spreadsheets
